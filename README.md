Quite Useless Tools - slideshow helps creating slideshows where occurence of given people is important.

# Motivation
As a scout chief, I often have to watch through thousands of pictures from the summer camp in order to pick the ones that are the bests, but also making sure that every child appears the same number of times, otherwise parents will be jaleous during the slideshow presentation.

This tool aims to facilitate this process of finding people in pictures and making slideshows which satisfy some criterions concerning apparition.
